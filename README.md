Sample Input:<br/><br/>
py project.py graph_data.txt <br/>
Returns all maximal cliques and boolean of whether graph is eulerian cycle <br/><br/>
Sample Input for Dijkstra's: <br/>
py dijkstra.py <br/>
Returns shortest path between vertices in driver code.<br/><br/>

Implementation 1: Return all maximal cliques in a given graph. <br/>
Implementation 2: Be able to return all vertex degrees of a given graph and determine whether graph is a Eulerian cycle. <br/>
Implementation 3: Perform Djikstras Algorithm on a given graph (could not quite get this working with ADT, but is working with hard coded version that is close to ADT)
